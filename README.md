#  Algo Trading Automation System

This project is a **algorithmic trading system** that is ML-augmented and rule-based, and it does the following:


Pulls daily stock data from Yahoo Finance and uses moving averages and RSI to implement a strategy.
Logs buy signals to Google Sheets
It incorporates a basic machine learning model (Decision Tree & Logistic Regression) and sends Telegram alerts for trades and ML predictions.
Completely automated and modular
